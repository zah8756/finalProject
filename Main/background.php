                This island is rather interesting because of its pristine nature. Many local animals and fauna are only found on the keys island and can be observed closely and personally. One of the many species found On Big Munson island is a unique breed of deer known as Key deer. These deer are unique to the keys, and their defining feature is their small stature. These mini deer are standard on the island; however, you have to be careful because they are an endangered species with little to no fear of humans.
