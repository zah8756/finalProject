                Sea Base itself is known as a boy scouts high adventure camp because of its unique camping environment in which you are able to camp on a deserted island for nearly a week. The base itself is a modified marina that, depending on the program you are attending, can be where you stay during the bulk of your time between activities. Otherwise, it will be the location where you are tested to see if you are on your swimming ability to know if you can take part in the more intensive courses. The area is surrounded by many living coral reefs, which you will be able to see firsthand during a snorkeling session regardless of what program you are attending. The base is also home to many sailing programs where regardless of your proficiency, the instructors will teach you how to sail firsthand.
